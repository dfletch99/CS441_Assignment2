# CS441_Assignment2 - Function grapher	
Using the GraphView widget, this app is able to plot any function of the formula y = ax^4 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + fx + g where a,b,c,d,f,g are doubles.

The graph itself will plot multiple curves, with a "CLEAR" button below it to reset. The curves will rotate between six colors: black, red, blue, purple, green, and yellow, to help distinguish between the different functions.

Tapping on the graph will create a temporary popup displaying the X and Y values. If there are multiple curves on the location tapped, the popup will rotate through all the values.

To avoid having to type in multiple "0"s for functions with lower degree, the app also contains buttons that will change the highest possible degree that can be input: linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic.
